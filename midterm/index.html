              <p>
                Africa’s rising population is driving demand for water and accelerating the degradation of water resources in many countries on the continent. Among developing regions, Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have the highest prevalence of urban slums and
                it is expected to double to around 400 million by 2020. Despite the efforts of some Sub-Saharan African countries and cities to expand basic services and improve urban housing conditions. Rapid and unplanned urban growth has increased
                the number of settlements on unstable, flood-prone, and high-risk land where phenomena such as landslides, rains, and earthquakes have devastating consequences.

              <p>
                Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, every year millions of people, most of them children,
                die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor
                families across the world. Drought afflicts some of the world’s poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.

        <h3>Poverty and Water</h3>
        <blockquote>
          "Poverty in Africa is often caused by a lack of access to clean, safe water and proper sanitation." (The Water Project)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          There are a number of reasons why poverty has become an epidemic in Africa. Poverty can be the result of political instability, ethnic conflicts, climate change and other man-made causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one of the greatest causes of poverty in Africa is also the most overlooked... the lack of access to clean drinking water.

      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3>How much water is needed?</h3>
        <p>
          Water is essential for life, health and human dignity. In extreme emergency situations, there may not be sufficient water available to meet basic needs and in these cases, supplying a minimum level of safe drinking-water for survival is of critical importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          People use water for a wide variety of activities. Some of these are more important than others. Having a few litres of water to drink each day, for example, is more important than having water for personal hygiene or laundry, but people will still want
          and need to wash for the prevention of skin diseases and meeting other physiological needs. Other uses of water have health and other benefits but decrease in urgency.
