    <h2>Good visualizations</h2>

        <p>This chart is a number line with media outlets placed according to the liberal/conservative political views of their readers. The mark used is points, and the channel used is position.</p>

        <p>This is a <strong>good visualization</strong> because it is clear and shows numerical data in a way that maps cleanly onto our existing mental models.</p>

        <p>Positives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Little chartjunk</li>
          <li>Clearly explains many potential sources of confusion (e.g. what happens if multiple data points are stacked.)</li>
          <li>Orders publications in a very intuitive and appropriate way: liberal on the left, conservative on the right. This maps cleanly onto our existing mental model of how we order political positions, making the visualization easy to understand.</li>
          <li>Draws eyes to the number line</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Negatives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lacks color, making it somewhat boring</li>
          <li>Lots of descriptive text at the top and bottom, which can distract the reader</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This visualization was likely meant for analysis; it aims to show the polarization in American media publications and to help consumers see which are the most biased. It could be improved in a few ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leverage colors, which the visualization currently doesn't take advantage of. It could color increasingly liberal publications in increasingly deep shades of blue and increasingly conservative ones in increasingly deep shades of red. This would
            invoke viewers' correlation of blue with liberal and red with conservative, which would further strengthen their impressions of the publications' leanings.</li>
          <li>Informed viewers are likely to know the logos of these publications. This visualization could include publications' logos in addition to their name to help viewers identify the publications faster.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <p>This is a modified map that visualizes the number of electoral votes assigned to each state and which presidential candidate is likely to win them. The mark used is area, and the channels are:
          <ul>
            <li>size (one tile per electoral vote)</li>
            <li>position (to indicate geographical relationships)</li>
            <li>color (to indicate partisan lean)</li>
            <li>value (to indicate the strength of the partisan lean)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>This is a <strong>good visualization</strong> because it is an attention-grabbing departure from a traditional electoral map that lets viewers see electoral politics more accurately.</p>

        <p>Positives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimal chartjunk</li>
          <li>Very high data-ink ratio</li>
          <li>This visualization removes the distortion present in traditional electoral maps (that is, the ones that scale states by their geographical size instead of their electoral votes.) Elections are decided by electoral votes (and hence by population),
            so in traditional maps the importance of large, sparse states (e.g. Montana) is overstated while the importance of small, dense states (e.g. New Jersey) is understated. This map ensures that states are scaled by the metric that really matters
            so that viewers aren't misled.</li>
          <li>The visualization looks just enough like a normal map to indicate that it's a map, but different enough to grab users' attention without resorting to flashy or distracting visuals.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Negatives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Without any descriptive text, the visualization assumes that viewers understand the electoral college, which limits its use to a select audience.</li>
          <li>Because every state has a different shape, comparing the size of two states is tricky (e.g. Texas appears to be the same size as Florida, even though Texas has 9 more electoral votes.)
        </ul>

        <p>This visualization aims to aid in analysis. It helps viewers understand the relative electoral importance of different regions of the country (e.g. the mountain West, though geographically large, has little electoral power) and see the sizes of
          each party's bases (e.g. the Democrats' stronghold of the Northeast is roughly equal in electoral power to the Republicans' stronghold of the South.) It could be improved a few ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removing the differences in value and making all states simply red or blue would make it mentally easier for viewers to see patterns in regional support. Currently, viewers have to mentally gather states of different shades of color, which takes
            some mental effort.</li>
          <li>Represent states as squares instead of their current "blobs" to help viewers compare relative sizes more easily.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Bad visualizations</h2>

    <div class="row panel panel-default panel-body">
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/planned-parenthood.jpg">
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <p>This is a line chart. The mark used is a line, and the channels used are position (to mark the change in rates over time) and color (to differentiate the two rates.) Though there is no y-axis, both sets of y-values represent the number of procedures
          executed in a given year. The x-values represent year.</p>

        <p>This is a <strong>bad visualization</strong> because the y-values are placed misleadingly and arbitrarily. This visualization lacks data integrity.</p>

        <p>Positives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimal chartjunk</li>
          <li>High data-ink ratio</li>
          <li>Clearly articulates the point it tries to make</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Negatives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The y-axis is missing</li>
          <li>y-values do not start at 0</li>
          <li>No consistent scale is used for the y-axis</li>
          <li>y-values are arbitrarily placed. Note that 327,000 is made to appear to be greater than 935,573, and that the magnitude of a drop from 2 million to 935,573 is shown to be the same as that of an increase from 289,750 to 327,000. This is extremely
            misleading and leads readers to faulty conclusions, namely that Planned Parenthood has started performing more abortions than prevention services (which is not true.)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>This visualization was used by anti-Planned Parenthood politicians to communicate that Planned Parenthood has turned its focus to abortions instead of health routines in an attempt to defund the organization. The data do not show this; health
          routines have declined, but abortions have not increased much. This visualization effectively communicates the point the authors want to make, but the point is false and the visualization is misleading. There are a few ways the authors could
          give the chart more integrity and clarity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a y-axis, start it at 0, and ensure that data points conform to that y-axis.</li>
          <li>Find data from intermediate years to show that data isn't just being cherry-picked.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is a type of bubble chart, except without axes. The mark used is area, and the channel used is size. The size of the bubbles represents the percent of people who hold a certain opinion. Color is used to identify the genders, but the age categories
          just use black.</p>
        <p> This is a <strong>bad visualization</strong> because the data is significantly distorted and the creator used the wrong kind of chart to visualize the data.</p>

        <p> Positives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Little chartjunk</li>
          <li>High data-ink ratio</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Negatives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The distortion of the data, as measured by the Tufte Lie Factor, is quite high. The circles are scaled by radius instead of area, so a 2x greater percentage actually appears 4x as large.</li>
          <li>The coloring of the men/women bubbles doesn't make sense. A more recognized color scheme like blue/pink for man/women would have helped readers identify the genders better.</li>
          <li>If a sample is being broken down into mutually exclusive categories (as each age/gender group is here), a stacked bar chart makes more sense than this bubble chart.
        </ul>

        <p>This visualization was likely meant for analysis instead of communication. The author likely wanted to convey how younger people and women are more likely to foresee a woman president. It could be improved in a few ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ordering of the age groups (&lt;45, 45-64, 65+) was effective in communicating this message, but the message could have been strengthened by using a more straightforward visualization like a bar chart.</li>
          <li> With all 5 bubbles stacked atop each other, there appears to be no discernable trend; visually separating the age breakdown from the gender breakdown would have made both takeaways easier to identify.</li>
        </ul>
